- > Reverse-engineering the brain in the absence of an adequate theory of computing is next to impossible.
  - Speed of learning
  - Retention over a lifetime
  - Generalization from a few examples
  - Reasoning by analogy
  - Tolerance for variability and noise in data
  - ...
- > People can identify languages by how they sound, without knowing the language
  - Intersting thought-exercise. cf., Audio LLMs
