- **Abstract**:
  - > The game of Go has long been viewed as the most challenging of classic games for artificial intelligence owing to its **enormous search space** and the difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves. Here we introduce a new approach to computer Go that uses **‘value networks’ to evaluate board positions and ‘policy networks’ to select moves**. These deep neural networks are **trained by a novel combination of supervised learning from human expert games, and reinforcement learning from games of self-play**. Without any lookahead search, the neural networks play Go at the level of stateof-the-art Monte Carlo tree search programs that simulate thousands of random games of self-play. We also introduce a new search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo simulation with value and policy networks. Using this search algorithm, our program AlphaGo achieved a 99.8% winning rate against other Go programs, and defeated the human European Go champion by 5 games to 0. This is the first time that a computer program has defeated a human professional player in the full-sized game of Go, a feat previously thought to be at least a decade away.
