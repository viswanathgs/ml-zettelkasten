  - > Circa 1878, Philipp von Jolly to Max Planck regarding pursuing theoretical physics: "In this field, almost everything is already discovered, and all that remains is to fill a few unimportant holes". Max Planck, before eventually going ahead and creating an entirely new field of Quantum Physics: "I don't wish to discover new things, only to understand the known fundamentals".
  - > "While extreme-scale LLMs are truly fascinating, there's something fundamentally odd about how they handle corner cases".
  - > "Whenever something new was invented in the history of humanity, the first solution has rarely been the optimal one; it's likely that there's a better solution that's not as compute heavy".
